## Sales Analytics Reports Detailed Implementation:

### ETL:
1. Extract Data directly from the Sales folder containing 4 files: dim_customer.csv, dim_market.csv, dim_product.csv, fact_sales_monthly.csv (dim: Dimension/Lookup Table, fact: Fact Table). 
All files in the folder will be combined in Power Query. To separate them we‚Äôll right click on main file and create references for all the individual files, this way if any data changes are done in the main file it will auto replicate in all the other files as well.
2. Data Cleaning: Check Data Quality: View ‚Üí Enable Column Distribution & Column Quality. For Primary Keys (customer_code, product_code, market), Distinct and Unique values in column should be the same.
3. Data Transformation:
  i.] In dim_customer: Find and Replace values: AltiQ ‚Üí AtliQ; Atliq ‚Üí AtliQ
  ii.] In dim_market, when extracting region/subzone NA (North America) got interpreted as Not Available value: Find and Replace values: nan ‚Üí NA
  iii.] In fact_sales_monthly, somewhere in the data pipeline negative values got introduced in the qty column: Column ‚Üí Transform ‚Üí Scientific ‚Üí Absolute value
4. Data Load: Save & Load To all 4 files as Connection Only and load then to the Data Model.

### Business Report Design Components:
- Net Sales: We‚Äôll get net_sales data from the fact_sales_monthly table from the net_sales_amount column.
- Year: We‚Äôll extract year data from the fact_sales_monthly table from the date column.
- Division: We‚Äôll get division data from the dim_product table from the division column.
- Country: We‚Äôll get country data from the dim_market table from the market column.
- Region: We‚Äôll get region data from the dim_market table from the region column.
- Customer: We‚Äôll get customer data from the dim_customer table from the customer column.

### Data Modelling:
1. In Power Pivot Diagram View, Arrange the 4 tables in a Star Schema with the fact_sales_monthly table in the center. There will be Snowflake Schema between dim_customer and dim_market.
2. Configure Table Relationships:

|Primary Key| |Foreign Key|
|-|-|-|
|customer_code (PK, dim_customer)|‚Üí|customer_code (FK, fact_sales_monthly)|
|product_code (PK, dim_product)|‚Üí|product_code (FK, fact_sales_monthly)|
|market (PK, dim_market)|‚Üí|market (FK, dim_customer)|

### New dim_date table using Power Query:
- This will provide us with the Year data and an added advantage of implementing date hierarchy when required.
1. Power Query ‚Üí New Query/New Source ‚Üí Other Sources ‚Üí Blank Query ‚Üí Rename as dim_date ‚Üí Add Query: = {Number.From(#date(2018,1,1))..Number.From(#date(2018,12,31))} ‚Üí Edit Start Date as (2018,9,1) and End Date as (2021,8,1) as per the Sales data ‚Üí Change column type to Date ‚Üí Rename column to date ‚Üí Extract Start of Month to new column, Rename to month ‚Üí Extract Year to new column, Set Data type as text to avoid future aggregation
2. AtliQ Hardware follows a fiscal year that runs from September through August. If the Fiscal Year starts from Sep to Aug, then we need to convert the Calendar Year to the Fiscal year, to do this in this case we‚Äôll have to add 4 months to the Calendar Date and the Year part of the new date will tell us the Fiscal year. E.g. Sep 2021 + 4 months = Jan 2022 ‚Üí FY 22
3. We‚Äôll add a custom column FY Month to dim_date to add the 4 months using DAX Formula: Date.AddMonths([month],4)
4. We‚Äôll then add a custom column FY to get the Year part from the FY Month column using DAX Formula: Date.Year([FY Month]). This can also be done from Add Column Tab, Date ‚Üí Year.
Remove year & FY Month column to avoid confusion.
5. In Power Pivot Data Model Diagram View, we‚Äôll now configure the table relationship: date (PK, dim_date) ‚Üí date (FK, fact_sales_monthly)

### Customer Sales Performance Report:
1. Insert Power Pivot from Insert Tab based on the Data Model created.
2. Add customer (from dim_customer) field to the Rows Area. Add region (from dim_market), market (from dim_market) & division (from dim_product) to Filters Area. Enable Select Multiple Items for Filters.
3. Create Net Sales Measure using DAX formula: SUM(fact_sales_monthly[net_sales_amount]) in the fact_sales_monthly table. Set data type as $ Currency with 2 decimal accuracy.
4. Now we‚Äôll create separate Net Sales Measures for each FY. For this we‚Äôll use the CALCULATE formulate to filter NetSales Measure in the Filter Context of FY column from dim_date table.

    Measure: NetSales2019 ‚Üí =CALCULATE([NetSales], dim_date[FY]="2019")

    Measure: NetSales2020 ‚Üí =CALCULATE([NetSales], dim_date[FY]="2020")

    Measure: NetSales2021 ‚Üí =CALCULATE([NetSales], dim_date[FY]="2021")

    (Since we had set the FY column of type text to avoid aggregation we need to put them in double quotes as string.)

5. Add a comparison Measure NetSales2021vs2020 using DAX formula: =DIVIDE([NetSales2021], [NetSales2020],0) and format it as Number Percentage with 1 decimal accuracy.
6. Add the NetSales2019, NetSales2020, NetSales2021 & NetSales2021vs2020 Measures to the Values Area in Power Pivot.
7. To boost User Readability:

    i. Convert all NetSales Measures to Million denomination by changing the Value Field Number Format to Custom: $ #,##0.0,, "M" ‚Üí This will give NetSales with 1 decimal accuracy in Million        Dollars.
   
    ii. Remove Gridlines and set Page Layout in View Tab along with Border setup.
   
8. Sort the Pivot Table by Descending NetSales 2021vs2020 Column values for best stakeholder experience in identifying Customers with high Sales Growth %. 
9. Configure Conditional Formatting:

    i. For all 3 NetSales Columns set Highlight Cell Formatting with 3 colour scale: White for low values, Light Yellow for average values and Dark Yellow for high values.
   
    ii. For the NetSales 2021vs2020 Column set Data Bar Formatting with Orange Gradient fill.
   
10. Add AtliQ Hardware Logo and ‚ÄúAtliQ Hardwares‚Äù as the Report Header Title. Add ‚ÄúCustomer Net Sales Performance Report‚Äù as the Report Title.

3. Create New Query to import data thorugh CSV file ns_targets_2021.csv. Configure Load as Connection Only and Add to Data Model.
4. In Power Pivot Data Model Diagram View, we‚Äôll now configure the table relationships:

|Primary Key| |Foreign Key|
|-|-|-|
|market (PK, dim_market)|‚Üí|market (FK, ns_targets_2021)|
|date (PK, dim_date)|‚Üí|date (FK, ns_targets_2021)|

5. Create SalesTarget2021 Measure using DAX formula: SUM(ns_targets_2021[ns_target]) in the ns_targets_2021 table. Set data type as $ Currency with 2 decimal accuracy.
6. Create Sales2021 - SalesTarget2021 Measure using DAX formula: [NetSales2021] - [SalesTarget2021] in the ns_targets_2021 table. Set data type as $ Currency with 2 decimal accuracy. Add this Measure to the Values Area in Pivot table.
7. Convert both the above Measures to Million denomination by changing the Value Field Number Format to Custom: $ #,##0.0,, "M" ‚Üí This will give Sales with 1 decimal accuracy in Million Dollars.
8. Create Sales2021 - SalesTarget2021 % Measure using DAX formula: DIVIDE([Sales2021 - SalesTarget2021], [SalesTarget2021], 0) in the ns_targets_2021 table. Set data type as Number Percentage with 1 decimal accuracy. Add this Measure to the Values Area in Pivot table.
