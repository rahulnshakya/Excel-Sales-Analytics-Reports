## Introduction:
**Domain:** FMCG | **Functions:** Sales & Finance

AtliQ Hardwares is a global provider of computer hardware and peripherals such as PCs, printers, and mice. 
The company primarily operates under a B2B model, supplying products to major retail partners like Croma, Best Buy, Staples, and Flipkart, who then sell to end consumers.

  
- Sales are conducted through **three primary channels** : Retailer, Direct, and Distributor.

  * **Retailer Channel:**
       AtliQ’s customers in this channel include:
      
      
    - Brick & Mortar Stores (e.g., **Croma, Best Buy** )
      
      
    - E-commerce Platforms (e.g., **Amazon, Flipkart** )
  
  
  * **Direct Channel:**
       The company also follows a smaller B2C model through its own outlets, including:
      
      
     - **AtliQ E-store**
      
      
     - **AtliQ Exclusive**
  
  
  * **Distributor Channel:**
       In regions with restricted trade policies, AtliQ partners with local distributors, such as **Neptune** .

## Problem Statement:
 AtliQ Hardwares has been experiencing substantial financial losses in recent years. One of the key issues identified is their continued reliance on handwritten reports for critical business decisions. This outdated approach has hindered their ability to make timely and data-driven decisions, creating an urgent need for actionable insights.
 
**Business Requirement:**
 To address this challenge, AtliQ’s business team has assigned the Data Analyst team the task of developing a comprehensive Excel-based analysis report. The focus is on evaluating Sales and Financial performance by consolidating and analyzing data from multiple sources, comprising over 1.5 million records. The objective is to extract meaningful insights that will support strategic decision-making and drive business growth.
